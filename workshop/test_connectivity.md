# Test connectivity and zoom BO

## Task 1

1.	Follow trainer instructions to download software material (with also this guide)

2.	Check which app-srv is assigned to you

    1.	Connect with your SSH client using the public IP and the provided ssh key.

    2.	Example of connections from Linux, MAC, Windows Powershell

    ```bash
    # bash
    ssh -i id_rsa_app-srv opc@<public_ip>
    sudo ls -l /tmp
    ls -l /tmp
    ```

    ```shell
    # shell
    ssh -i id_rsa_app-srv opc@<public_ip>
    sudo ls -l /tmp
    ls -l /tmp
    ```

    ```ShellScript
    # ShellScript
    ssh -i id_rsa_app-srv opc@<public_ip>
    sudo ls -l /tmp
    ls -l /tmp
    ```

    ```console
    # console
    ssh -i id_rsa_app-srv opc@<public_ip>
    sudo ls -l /tmp
    ls -l /tmp
    ```

    3.	Example of connection using PUTTY is in the addendum “A7) Putty configuration”.

3.	Zoom break-out rooms are isolated each other.
To ask trainers help, you must use the button “Ask for help” in the zoom interface, then confirm the request (see pictures below). The message “The Host has been invited” disappear after a short time.

Press it now and wait that the trainer join your session.
