# MySQL Essential Bootcamp
 
This repository is not generic and used **only for dedicated, MySQL handled, workshops**.

***Don't use it as a reference, best practice or other ways outside of its scope (the MySQL Implementation Bootcamp).***

Wrong use of these labs may give you wrong understanding and problems with your MySQL servers.

Of course, if you have questions on it, feel free to reach me at marco.carlessi@oracle.com.
